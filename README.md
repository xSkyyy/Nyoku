`git clone https://github.com/mattylive/nyoku`
2. cd into the directory
`cd nyoko`

4. Edit config.py
`nano config.py` 
5. Run the bot

# Current uses

I'll be honest, this bot doesn't have many uses currently. You can check out the production build that will be running 24/7 on my [Discord server.](https://discord.gg/HdRtYrdK7p)
