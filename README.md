`git clone https://github.com/mattylive/nyoko`
2. cd into the directory
`cd nyoko`
3. Install requirements
`python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run the bot
`python3.6 main.py`

# Current uses

I'll be honest, this bot doesn't have many uses currently. You can check out the production build that will be running 24/7 on my [Discord server.](https://discord.gg/HdRtYrdK7p)
